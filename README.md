## UIKit Storyboard Constraints and User Interface Interaction 

### Discovering and Playing with UIKit Storyboard Constraints 
This project serves as an exploration of UIKit and storyboard constraints to create a visually appealing and interactive user interface. UIKit provides powerful tools for creating iOS applications with a variety of UI elements and layouts.

### Key Elements Explored: 

1. Storyboard Constraints:

- Learn and experiment with Auto Layout constraints in UIKit storyboards. 
- Understand how to position and size UI elements dynamically based on different device sizes and orientations. 

2. User Interface Design:

- Utilize Interface Builder in Xcode to design an aesthetically pleasing user interface. 
- Explore the placement of UIImageView, UILabel, and other UI elements to create a visually appealing layout. 

### Creating a Simple User Interface Displaying a List of Furnitures 

#### Project Overview: 
This project demonstrates the creation of a basic iOS application displaying a list of furniture items. Each item is presented with an image and a corresponding description.

#### Project Structure: 
- ViewController:

    Utilizes UIImageView and UILabel to represent furniture images and descriptions. 
    Implements Auto Layout constraints in the storyboard for responsive design. 
    
- Furniture Model:

    Defines a simple data structure (Furniture) to hold information about each furniture item. - 
- Furniture Array:

    Populates an array with instances of the Furniture model to represent the list of furniture items. 
    
### Making an Element Clickable using UITapGestureRecognizer 

The user interface incorporates user interaction by making certain elements clickable. In this case, `UITapGestureRecognizer` is employed to enable tapping on specific UIImageViews, allowing users to navigate through the list of furniture items.

### Usage: 
1. Clone the repository. 
2. Open the Xcode project file. 
3. Explore the implementation of Auto Layout constraints in the storyboard. 
4. Run the project on a simulator or physical device to experience the user interface.
